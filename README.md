# Localized-Twitch-Bot

The following is intended to be an easy to use bot for Twitch that will extend what is possible from existing third party apps such as in game interactions and audio/visual cues. The intent is to create a bot so easy any computer skill level streamer can operate. Designed for Windows use only at the moment. 

If you would like to see this in action before using please stop by [Axiova's Twitch Channel](twitch.tv/axiova) as he is my test subject for new features. 

Before using you must install/update [Node.JS version 16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (Subject to change as development continues). 

Work on this will only continue as there is a need. If you have feature requests/find bugs/or want to see more in the future please let me know. I can also be bribed to continue work on this if you buy me a beer.
